# -Home-Network-Traffic-Observation-Beginner-Friendly-
The goal is to improve understanding of normal network behavior and basic security awareness

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple and ethical approach to observing network traffic in a home environment.
The goal is to improve understanding of normal network behavior and basic security awareness.

This project is part of KaredokNet, focused on practical and understandable network security.

---

## Environment
- Network: Home / Lab
- Scope: Local network only
- Authorization: Network owned and managed by me
- OS: Linux

---

## Tools Used
- tcpdump
- Wireshark

---

## What Was Done
- Captured a short sample of network traffic
- Analyzed protocol distribution using Wireshark
- Observed normal vs potentially risky traffic patterns
- Interpreted findings in non-technical language

---

## Key Observations
- DNS traffic was frequent and expected
- Most web traffic was encrypted (TLS)
- Some HTTP traffic was still present
- Broadcast and service discovery traffic observed

---

## Recommendations
- Prefer encrypted protocols whenever possible
- Limit insecure services on the local network
- Periodically review traffic behavior
- Educate users about safe network usage

---

## Screenshots
Sensitive identifiers have been anonymized.

---

## Ethical Note
Traffic observation was passive and limited in scope.
No credentials were intercepted, decrypted, or targeted.
This project focuses on awareness and education only.
